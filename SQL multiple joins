Here is a SQL query that uses multiple joins to return the customer ids, names, locations, and amount spent by Rockbuster's top 5 customers (by total amount spent).

SELECT A.customer_id,
  A.first_name,
  A.last_name,
  C.city,
  D.country,
  SUM(E.amount) AS total_amount_paid
FROM customer A
INNER JOIN address B ON A.address_id=B.address_id
INNER JOIN city C ON B.city_id=C.city_id
INNER JOIN country D ON C.country_id=D.country_id
INNER JOIN payment E ON A.customer_id=E.customer_id
WHERE C.city IN ('Aurora',
    'Atlixco',
    'Xintai',
    'Adoni',
    'Dhule (Dhulia)',
    'Kurashiki',
    'Pingxiang',
    'Sivas',
    'Celaya',

GROUP BY A.customer_id,
  C.city,

ORDER BY SUM(E.amount) DESC
LIMIT 5

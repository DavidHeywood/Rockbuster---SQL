Here is a SQL query that uses a subquery to return the total number of customers as well as the number of 'top customers' in each country.

SELECT D.country,
	COUNT(DISTINCT A.customer_id) AS all_customer_count,
	COUNT(DISTINCT top_5_customers.customer_id) AS top_customer_count
FROM customer A
INNER JOIN address B ON A.address_id=B.address_id
INNER JOIN city C ON B.city_id=C.city_id
INNER JOIN country D ON C.country_id=D.country_id

LEFT JOIN -- Creating the top_5_customers table via a subquery

	(SELECT A.customer_id, A.first_name, A.last_name, C.city, D.country, SUM(E.amount) AS total_paid
	FROM customer A
	INNER JOIN address B ON A.address_id=B.address_id
	INNER JOIN city C ON B.city_id=C.city_id
	INNER JOIN country D ON C.country_id=D.country_id
	INNER JOIN payment E ON A.customer_id=E.customer_id
	WHERE C.city IN ('Aurora', 
    'Atlixco', 
    'Xintai', 
    'Adoni', 
    'Dhule (Dhulia)', 
    'Kurashiki', 
    'Pingxiang', 
    'Sivas', 
    'Celaya', 
    'So Leopoldo')
	GROUP BY A.customer_id, C.city, D.country
	ORDER BY SUM(E.amount) DESC
	LIMIT 5) AS top_5_customers

	ON D.country=top_5_customers.country -- Completing the LEFT JOIN
  
GROUP BY D.country
ORDER BY top_customer_count DESC

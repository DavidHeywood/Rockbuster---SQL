Here is a SQL query that uses a Common Table Expression (CTE) to return the 

WITH top_5_customers (customer_id, first_name, last_name, city, country, total_paid) AS
(SELECT A.customer_id, A.first_name, A.last_name, C.city, D.country,
		SUM(E.amount) AS total_paid
	FROM customer A
	INNER JOIN address B ON A.address_id=B.address_id
	INNER JOIN city C ON B.city_id=C.city_id
	INNER JOIN country D ON C.country_id=D.country_id
	INNER JOIN payment E ON A.customer_id=E.customer_id
	WHERE C.city IN ('Aurora', 'Atlixco', 'Xintai', 'Adoni', 'Dhule (Dhulia)', 'Kurashiki', 
'Pingxiang', 'Sivas', 'Celaya', 'So Leopoldo')
	GROUP BY A.customer_id, C.city, D.country
	ORDER BY SUM(E.amount) DESC
	LIMIT 5)
SELECT D.country,
	COUNT(DISTINCT A.customer_id) AS all_customer_count,
	COUNT(DISTINCT top_5_customers.customer_id) AS top_customer_count
FROM customer A
INNER JOIN address B ON A.address_id=B.address_id
INNER JOIN city C ON B.city_id=C.city_id
INNER JOIN country D ON C.country_id=D.country_id
LEFT JOIN top_5_customers ON D.country=top_5_customers.country
GROUP BY D.country
ORDER BY top_customer_count DESC

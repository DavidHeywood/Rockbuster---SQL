# Rockbuster-SQL
SQL queries for a fictional film rental company.  Part of the CareerFoundry data analytics course.
## Background Information
Rockbuster Stealth LLC is a (fictional) movie rental company that was looking to transition from brick-and-mortar rental stores to online streaming.  The management board had a series of business questions related to this transition.  In order to answer these questions, I queried data from the Rockbuster database using Postgre SQL.  
## Data
The data was stored in a relational database made up of 17 tables containing information about customers, employees, and films rented.  For more information about the contents of these tables, please see the entity relationship diagram (ERD) included in this repo.

# Rockbuster-SQL
This repository contains SQL queries for a fictional film rental company. I wrote the queries during my completion of CareerFoundry's data analytics course.
## Background Information
Rockbuster Stealth LLC is a (fictional) movie rental company that was looking to transition from brick-and-mortar rental stores to online streaming.  The management board had a series of business questions related to this transition.  In order to answer these questions, I queried data from the Rockbuster database using Postgre SQL.  
## Data
The data was stored in a relational database made up of 17 tables containing information about customers, employees, and films rented.  For more information about the contents of these tables, please see the [entity relationship diagram (ERD)](ERD.jpeg) included in this repo.
## Deliverables
I put together a [presentation](BusinessManagersPresentation.pdf) for the management board.  The visualizations used in the presentation were created using [Tableau](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/david.heywood)
